# what is this project

This is a copy of the OpenTelemetry demo project, deployed by the Honeycomb Developer Relations team to show various observability things.
This directory contains documentation useful to an AI agent (maybe also humans).

## instructions for the agent

Look at ACTIVE.md to see what we are doing together right now.



As you're going, you can write more documentation in this directory as you learn about this project.
