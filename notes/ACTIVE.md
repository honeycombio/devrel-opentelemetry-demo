## Fixed React Hydration Error in PlatformFlag Component

### Problem
The Next.js frontend was experiencing React hydration errors in production due to inconsistent client/server rendering in the `PlatformFlag` component.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Development/Local**: Uses `envOverrides` in `demo-values.yaml` to set `ENV_PLATFORM=local` globally
- **Production**: Sets `ENV_PLATFORM=production` directly in kubernetes deployment manifest 

The hydration error occurred because:
1. Server-side rendering used `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM` (from `ENV_PLATFORM` via `next.config.js`)  
2. Client-side rendering tried to access `window.ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM` (injected via script in `_document.tsx`)
3. This created a timing mismatch causing hydration errors

### Solution Applied
Fixed `src/frontend/components/PlatformFlag/PlatformFlag.tsx` to use consistent environment variable access:

**Before:**
```typescript
const { NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM = 'local' } = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.ENV : {};
const platform = NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const platform = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM || 'local';
```

### Key Benefits
- âœ… Eliminates server/client hydration mismatch
- âœ… Uses Next.js built-in environment variable handling
- âœ… Works consistently in both development and production
- âœ… Simpler, more reliable code

### Files Modified
- `src/frontend/components/PlatformFlag/PlatformFlag.tsx` - Fixed environment variable access

### Testing Status
- âœ… Build passes successfully
- ðŸ”„ User will test deployment to verify fix resolves production hydration errors
